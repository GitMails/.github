# Hello, World! :wave:

Welcome to the GitMails organization on GitHub. 

## Instant Notifications for Critical Github Org Events.
GitMails  :rocket: is a github marketplace application that sends github organization owners notification emails when a critical github event has been
triggered. It helps in keeping track of potential hazardous activities in a organization. GitMails is currently free for both public and 
private github organizations.

Github Organisations is the home to all your source code, packages, CI CD and developers. As the organisation grows it gets very tricky
to maintain and and have a clear view on all github events. Repositories get deleted and are made public by accident many times.
I have personally caused an issue and didnt notice it until later. That is the motivation behind GitMails.GitMails tries to lookout for
potentially hazardous events that occur on your github organization and sends the org owner an email notification to act upon if necessary.

It is currently free for public and private organisations.
